 "description": "FLA (Flashy Token) is the platform currency of the Flashy ecosystem, with a total issuance of 10 billion. FLA is exchanged, repurchased and destroyed during the Flashy ecological application process until the total amount of FLA is destroyed to 1 billion. Exchange and repurchase will deflate FLA. In theory, if the total value of FLA remains unchanged, exchange and repurchase can increase the currency price.",
