    "description": "The TCP314 protocol changes the traditional on-chain DEX contract interaction mode. Users transfer BNB to the contract to buy, and transfer $TCP314 to the contract to sell, without any SWAP transaction. The original 314 protocol is upgraded and expanded, and the pool automatically destroys 6% of the current total number of TCP314 every 24 hours.",
