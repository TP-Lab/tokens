 "description": "Oscar Pass (OSK Token) is the first platform of blockchain copyright registration and digital asset management, which includes the underlying blockchain framework of Oscar Token, as well as the IP asset exchange as the core business system. Based on the advantages of blockchain technology, such as traceability, non-tampering, and accurate recordings of every ownership registration, transaction and circulation, Oscar Token has laid the foundation for asset-based ownership transactions and trusted cultural big data. OSK tokens are minted by holding FIST tokens. The total amount is fixed and will never be issued. Currently the OSK Token is undergoing code upgrade, as well as Certik's all-round audit. After passing Certik's audit and opening Skynet, cross-chain migration is carried out to ensure that the interests of Pangu Consensus are truly guaranteed. OSK Token will be listed on the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange after completing migration.",
