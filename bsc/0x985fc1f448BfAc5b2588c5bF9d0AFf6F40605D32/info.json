 "description": "Alec is the main application of Alec network on the BSC chain to generate tokens. In the Alec pool mechanism, 75% of Alec tokens will flow into the pool. The daily production is 40000 Alec tokens. Every six months is a cycle. When the first cycle ends, the output of the second cycle will decrease by 50%. When Alec is traded, a 1% backflow mechanism will be generated. When the backflow pool reaches a certain ratio, the backflow pool will automatically destroy 50% of the tokens of the backflow pool, and the remaining 50% of the backflow pool will reward the community to contact the workers, effectively ensuring the stability of Alec tokens.",
