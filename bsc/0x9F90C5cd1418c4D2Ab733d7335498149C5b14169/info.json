 "description": "With the technical barriers broken through by the BSC-314 protocol, it breaks the multiple limitations and other characteristics of traditional digital finance that must rely on exchanges to list swapsAnd integrate the second-layer network of each ecology, which is open, fair and just, and runs BT2 as an asset support on the whole chain. The circulation of BT2 integrates human needs, completely breaking the blockchain digital finance, and cannot automatically execute fairness on the chain. Publicity rewards, the inherent magic of node dividends.There is no authorization risk in the entire ecosystem. Transfers are transactions, and you never worry about trading pairs being delisted. 100% permissions are discarded. We continue to create a highly sticky ecological environment and can finally realize the original intention that BTC failed to achieve.",
